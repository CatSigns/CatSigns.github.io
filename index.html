                    <p class="about__text">
                        Today, the role of a business analyst is vital in powering any successful
                        digital business. Bringing broad and enduring value, business analysts
                        translate business needs into the right buildable solutions and processes. <br>
                        Our Business Analyst course will provide you an immersed experience in
                        responding to an in-depth scenario that follows each stage of the business
                        analysis lifecycle. You’ll learn the key transferable skills required by a
                        valuable business analyst which are causation, facilitation, problem solving,
                        work breakdown, and adaptive communication. <br>
                        Importantly, you’ll gain universal technical skills in requirements gathering,
                        process mapping, and user story writing. Simulating common real-life
                        situations that require problem-solving, you’ll also learn how to update
                        process maps based on changed requirements and review non-functional
                        requirements. By the end of this course, you’ll present your findings through
                        a stakeholder presentation and video for your final, scenario-based project.
